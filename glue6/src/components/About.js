The fate of my entertainment was up to my grandma or grandad, so usually we'd watch old reruns of Walker Texas Ranger. <hr/>This glue lab started off as a joke, but I now realize I hold great nostalgia for my childhood; I miss the simple times of sitting on the floor, singing along to the theme song with my grandparents.<br/>Please enjoy!</p>
